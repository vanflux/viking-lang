# Viking Lang

Core repository for viking _things_: assembler, compiler (WIP) and simulator/debugger.

Viking is an architecture developed by [sjohann81](https://github.com/sjohann81/viking) for educational purposes, but I decided to extend this and re-implement the assembler and the [simulator](https://github.com/vanflux/viking-sim-web).

The current goal is to build a simple compiler to generate assembly code from a C like language(viking-lang).

## Installation

The package is available at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viking-lang). Is intented to be used in [viking-sim-web](https://github.com/vanflux/viking-sim-web), but, of course, you can use only the core.

```
npm i viking-lang
```

## Usage

It is not finished yet, assembler and simulator are usable at this point.
