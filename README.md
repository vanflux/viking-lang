# Viking Lang

Core repository for viking *things*: assembler, compiler and simulator/debugger.

Viking is an architecture developed by [sjohann81](https://github.com/sjohann81/viking) for educational purposes, but I decided to extend this and re-implement the assembler and the [simulator](https://github.com/vanflux/viking-sim-web).

The current goal is to build a simple compiler to generate assembly code from a C like language(viking-lang).

If you go to `compiler` branch you'll see that I haven't worked on for a long time. I have this problem of starting things, stopping, continuing, stopping...
